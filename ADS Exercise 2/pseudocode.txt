Base Case: Returns the same character
Recursive Case 1: Runs the method with the first character at the end

Base Case: Adds the number to a sum = 0, and return the sum
Recursive Case 1: Add the first digit to a sum and remove that digit and put the new number through the function again.

Base Case: Adds 1 or 0 to a sum depending on whether or not the one digit is a 7 and then returns the sum
Recursive Case 1: Checks the first digit to see if it as a 7 and adds 1 or 0 appropriatly. Then, it removes the digit and inputs the new unmber into the function again.

Base Case: Multiples the value into the return value variable and returns return value
Recursive Case 1: multiples the return value variable into the given number and then recursivly calls the function using the same number and the second number minus 1.

Base Case: Returns false
Recursive Case 1: Takes the current index and checks if the next index is equal to 10x this value. Returns true or it runs the function again starting at the next index.

Base Case: 
Recursive Case 1:
Recursive Case 2:

Base Case: Checks the one character to see if there in a string of vowels and add 1 or 0 to a sum. Then the sum is returned. 
Recursive Case 1: Adds 1 or 0, approprtly, to the return value and runs the the fucntion again using the substring that omits the first character.

Base Case: Returns 1
Recursive Case: If the first digit is equal to the last digit, it runs the function again with the first and the last digit removed.
