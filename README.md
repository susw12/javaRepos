# My Java Repo
*These are for Blair CS*

## [Download all PSETs here](https://github.com/susw12/javaRepos/archive/master.zip)

## Why did I make this?
**To share code and recieve code when someone is in a pinch**
## What to not do.
**Do not send anyfiles to anybody that is not already in this shared repo**
**Put your stuff in your own branch**
**Now that the teachers who taught this class are long gone, prepare to archive
